### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![dylang's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=dylang&show_icons=true&theme=dark)](https://github.com/dylang)

I enjoy working on open source, but the work I've been doing for the last five years at Medallia is not yet open source.

Developer, mentor, and leader with a passion for developer happiness and efficiency, building maintainable and testable code, and the fast moving world of JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.

Passionate and experienced with regards to tooling, security, performance, E2E testing, modern JavaScript best practices.

Contributor to open source projects like npm, Yarn, Jest.

I created these years ago when nothing like them existed. They're still fairly well used!

Fan of finding problems and solving them, monorepos, TypeScript, and, whenever possible, including chuckle-worthy gifs in code reviews.
